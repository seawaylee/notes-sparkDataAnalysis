This tutorial provides a quick introduction to using Spark. We will first introduce the API through Spark’s interactive shell (in Python or Scala), then show how to write applications in Java, Scala, and Python. See the programming guide for a more complete reference.

To follow along with this guide, first download a packaged release of Spark from the Spark website. Since we won’t be using HDFS, you can download a package for any version of Hadoop.

Interactive Analysis with the Spark Shell
Basics
Spark’s shell provides a simple way to learn the API, as well as a powerful tool to analyze data interactively. It is available in either Scala (which runs on the Java VM and is thus a good way to use existing Java libraries) or Python. Start it by running the following in the Spark directory:

Scala
Python
./bin/spark-shell
Spark’s primary abstraction is a distributed collection of items called a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). RDDs can be created from Hadoop InputFormats (such as HDFS files) or by transforming other RDDs. Let’s make a new RDD from the text of the README file in the Spark source directory:

scala> val textFile = sc.textFile("README.md")
textFile: spark.RDD[String] = spark.MappedRDD@2ee9b6e3
RDDs have actions, which return values, and transformations, which return pointers to new RDDs. Let’s start with a few actions:

scala> textFile.count() // Number of items in this RDD
res0: Long = 126

scala> textFile.first() // First item in this RDD
res1: String = # Apache Spark
Now let’s use a transformation. We will use the filter transformation to return a new RDD with a subset of the items in the file.

scala> val linesWithSpark = textFile.filter(line => line.contains("Spark"))
linesWithSpark: spark.RDD[String] = spark.FilteredRDD@7dd4af09
We can chain together transformations and actions:

scala> textFile.filter(line => line.contains("Spark")).count() // How many lines contain "Spark"?
res3: Long = 15
More on RDD Operations
RDD actions and transformations can be used for more complex computations. Let’s say we want to find the line with the most words:

Scala
Python
scala> textFile.map(line => line.split(" ").size).reduce((a, b) => if (a > b) a else b)
res4: Long = 15
This first maps a line to an integer value, creating a new RDD. reduce is called on that RDD to find the largest line count. The arguments to map and reduce are Scala function literals (closures), and can use any language feature or Scala/Java library. For example, we can easily call functions declared elsewhere. We’ll use Math.max() function to make this code easier to understand:

scala> import java.lang.Math
import java.lang.Math

scala> textFile.map(line => line.split(" ").size).reduce((a, b) => Math.max(a, b))
res5: Int = 15
One common data flow pattern is MapReduce, as popularized by Hadoop. Spark can implement MapReduce flows easily:

scala> val wordCounts = textFile.flatMap(line => line.split(" ")).map(word => (word, 1)).reduceByKey((a, b) => a + b)
wordCounts: spark.RDD[(String, Int)] = spark.ShuffledAggregatedRDD@71f027b8
Here, we combined the flatMap, map, and reduceByKey transformations to compute the per-word counts in the file as an RDD of (String, Int) pairs. To collect the word counts in our shell, we can use the collect action:

scala> wordCounts.collect()
res6: Array[(String, Int)] = Array((means,1), (under,2), (this,3), (Because,1), (Python,2), (agree,1), (cluster.,1), ...)
Caching
Spark also supports pulling data sets into a cluster-wide in-memory cache. This is very useful when data is accessed repeatedly, such as when querying a small “hot” dataset or when running an iterative algorithm like PageRank. As a simple example, let’s mark our linesWithSpark dataset to be cached:

Scala
Python
scala> linesWithSpark.cache()
res7: spark.RDD[String] = spark.FilteredRDD@17e51082

scala> linesWithSpark.count()
res8: Long = 19

scala> linesWithSpark.count()
res9: Long = 19
It may seem silly to use Spark to explore and cache a 100-line text file. The interesting part is that these same functions can be used on very large data sets, even when they are striped across tens or hundreds of nodes. You can also do this interactively by connecting bin/spark-shell to a cluster, as described in the programming guide.

Self-Contained Applications
Suppose we wish to write a self-contained application using the Spark API. We will walk through a simple application in Scala (with sbt), Java (with Maven), and Python.

Scala
Java
Python
We’ll create a very simple Spark application in Scala–so simple, in fact, that it’s named SimpleApp.scala:

/* SimpleApp.scala */
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext._
import org.apache.spark.SparkConf

object SimpleApp {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val logFile = "YOUR_SPARK_HOME/README.md" // Should be some file on your system
    val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("Simple Application")
    val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
    val logData = sc.textFile(logFile, 2).cache()
    val numAs = logData.filter(line => line.contains("a")).count()
    val numBs = logData.filter(line => line.contains("b")).count()
    println("Lines with a: %s, Lines with b: %s".format(numAs, numBs))
  }
}
Note that applications should define a main() method instead of extending scala.App. Subclasses of scala.App may not work correctly.

This program just counts the number of lines containing ‘a’ and the number containing ‘b’ in the Spark README. Note that you’ll need to replace YOUR_SPARK_HOME with the location where Spark is installed. Unlike the earlier examples with the Spark shell, which initializes its own SparkContext, we initialize a SparkContext as part of the program.

We pass the SparkContext constructor a SparkConf object which contains information about our application.

Our application depends on the Spark API, so we’ll also include an sbt configuration file, simple.sbt, which explains that Spark is a dependency. This file also adds a repository that Spark depends on:

name := "Simple Project"

version := "1.0"

scalaVersion := "2.10.5"

libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-core" % "1.6.2"
For sbt to work correctly, we’ll need to layout SimpleApp.scala and simple.sbt according to the typical directory structure. Once that is in place, we can create a JAR package containing the application’s code, then use the spark-submit script to run our program.

# Your directory layout should look like this
$ find .
.
./simple.sbt
./src
./src/main
./src/main/scala
./src/main/scala/SimpleApp.scala

# Package a jar containing your application
$ sbt package
...
[info] Packaging {..}/{..}/target/scala-2.10/simple-project_2.10-1.0.jar

# Use spark-submit to run your application
$ YOUR_SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
  --class "SimpleApp" \
  --master local[4] \
  target/scala-2.10/simple-project_2.10-1.0.jar
...
Lines with a: 46, Lines with b: 23

Congratulations on running your first Spark application!

For an in-depth overview of the API, start with the Spark programming guide, or see “Programming Guides” menu for other components.
For running applications on a cluster, head to the deployment overview.
Finally, Spark includes several samples in the examples directory (Scala, Java, Python, R). You can run them as follows:
# For Scala and Java, use run-example:
./bin/run-example SparkPi

# For Python examples, use spark-submit directly:
./bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/python/pi.py

# For R examples, use spark-submit directly:
./bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/r/dataframe.R
